The draw-rectangle.html pages allows you to draw rectangles and notifies you when 1 or more rectangles interesect.
If you want to run it simply copy the location of your draw-rectangles.html page and paste it in your browser.
Since there was no persistence layer, I opted to simply have an html file with a script and a style tag with all of the functions/css needed.
